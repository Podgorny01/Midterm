# Skincare 

## Why is skincare important?

I consider taking care of one's face a part of their personal **hygiene**. Just like how brushing your teeth twice a day is good hygiene, so is washing your face once a day. Some people may not be able to afford skincare, or they may not have the time. However, if someone does have money and time, then they should invest in a little *skincare*.
